All thesis codes and documentation and data can be found here

## 1 - Actual Thesis Document PDF

1 - Document PDF [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/Stephen_Brutch_ERAU_Thesis__final_%20(1).pdf)

  - for ease of skimming the paper you should probably just download the pdf
  - also this is the near final version, this one still needs to go through "corrections" but this pdf is 99.999999% the final version

2 - Thesis Slides [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/thesis%20final%20defense%20rough%20draft%20slides.pptx)

## 2 - Foundational PINN Model

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/PINN_foundational_model.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 3-Section 2 aka 3.2

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code, [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/foundational%20PINN%20data.zip) for the zip file of data. The code is also in this zip file.

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 3.2 should serve enough of a pseudo readme


## 3 - PINN Model 2

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/pinn_with_autodiff.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 4

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code ---still working on how to upload the data since large file size---

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 4 should serve enough of a pseudo readme

## 4 - PINN Model 3

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/PINN_large_data_model_with_tau.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 5

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code ---still working on how to upload the data since large file size---

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 5 should serve enough of a pseudo readme

## 5 - PINN Model 4

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/Copy_of_PINN_large_data_model_with_tau_transferfunction.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 6

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code ---still working on how to upload the data since large file size---

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 6 should serve enough of a pseudo readme

## 6 - SciKit Learn

1 - For the commented/clean Code and save the models [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/sklearn_code_and_simulator_test%20copy.ipynb)

2 - For examplanation go to thesis document Chapter 7 and section 2.4 for the background.

3 - SkLearn modeling is made simpler because they are pre made functions that you can import into your python code, thus the barrier of entry is very low to understand the codes

4 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code ---still working on how to upload the data since large file size---

## 7 - Pilot-induced oscillation and Flying qualities

1 - For the clean/commented code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/pio_code%20copy%202.ipynb)

  - this code covers how to get the pio values, how to create a model for pio estimation, and how to get general flying qualities

2 - For explanation go to thesis document section 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 for the background and Chapter 8

## 8 - System Integration

## 9 - Flight Tests

## 10 - Sci Tech Paper

1 - For scitech paper title "Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms to Human-Pilot-Model Parameter Estimation"

 2 - For the clean/commented code:
    
  - For code to train the sklearn models in simulation and save the models [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/sklearn_code_and_simulator_test%20copy.ipynb)
    
  - For code to train the CNN, RNN, NN models in simulation and save the models [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/LSTM_PINN%20copy.ipynb)
    
  - For code to test the saved sklearn and NN models on simulator data [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/test_models_on_simulator_data.ipynb)

  - For the zip file of the models that are saved and I then tested them in the codes [click here](https://myerauedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/brutchs_my_erau_edu/EugrSq7oaFdOtrskAVhFqG8BhAWeA0BkJeNyS17HgFtShQ?e=yNNkcv). Because the zip file is so big I have it uploaded as a folder to OneDrive.

      - The input sizes are described in the paper. However I will put it briefly here for simplification: for the CNN,RNN requires input shape of n, 1000, 5 and for SkLearn models and dense NN requires input shape of n, 5000.

3 - For explanation see paper lol
