All thesis codes and documentation and data can be found here

## 1 - Actual Thesis Document PDF

1 - Document PDF [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/Stephen_Brutch_ERAU_Thesis__final_%20(1).pdf)

  - for ease of skimming the paper you should probably just download the pdf
  - also this is the near final version, this one still needs to go through "corrections" but this pdf is 99.999999% the final version

## 2 - Foundational PINN Model

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/PINN_foundational_model.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 3-Section 2 aka 3.2

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code, [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/foundational%20PINN%20data.zip) for the zip file of data. The code is also in this zip file.

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 3.2 should serve enough of a pseudo readme


## 3 - PINN Model 2

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/pinn_with_autodiff.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 4

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code ---still working on how to upload the data since large file size---

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 4 should serve enough of a pseudo readme

## 4 - PINN Model 3

1 - For the commented/clean Code [click here](https://github.com/stephenbrutch/Thesis-codes-and-documentation/blob/main/PINN_large_data_model_with_tau.ipynb)

2 - For explanataion go to thesis document and it should be Chapter 5

3 - For the data I used so that u can import it into the code and run the code ---still working on how to upload the data since large file size---

Final Thoughts: The code should be well explained enough with comments and the code along with thesis section 5 should serve enough of a pseudo readme
